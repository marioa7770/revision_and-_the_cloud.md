Git stores files in a system made of snapshots. You are able to save your files by "commiting" them, git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. With Git it would be extremely difficult to lose any files. Files in git live in three stages commited,modified and staged. In a commited state the data is stored locally, in a modified state the file has been changed but not commited to the data base, in a staged state a file is flagged to be changed/ committed in the next snapshot.
